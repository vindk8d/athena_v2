# Product Requirements Document: Athena Digital Executive Assistant

## Introduction/Overview

Athena is a Digital Executive Assistant that operates as a Telegram bot to streamline meeting coordination and contact management. The system automatically gathers contact information, manages calendar scheduling, and facilitates meeting coordination through natural conversation. Athena integrates with Google Calendar, stores contact data in Supabase, and provides a web-based management interface for configuration and oversight.

**Problem Statement:** Manual coordination of meetings and contact information gathering is time-consuming and prone to back-and-forth communication inefficiencies.

**Goal:** Create an intelligent assistant that automates contact information collection and meeting scheduling through conversational AI, reducing administrative overhead by 80%.

## Goals

1. **Automated Contact Management:** Seamlessly collect and store contact information (name, email, Telegram ID) through natural conversation
2. **Intelligent Meeting Scheduling:** Coordinate calendar availability and schedule meetings with minimal human intervention
3. **Contextual Awareness:** Maintain conversation history and recognize returning contacts for personalized interactions
4. **Administrative Control:** Provide managers with easy-to-use preferences management and system oversight
5. **Reliable Integration:** Ensure seamless connectivity with Telegram, Google Calendar, and Supabase

## User Stories

### Primary Users (Contacts)
- **As a colleague/friend,** I want to easily provide my contact information through natural conversation so that I can be added to the contact system effortlessly
- **As a returning contact,** I want Athena to recognize me and reference our previous conversations so that I don't have to repeat information
- **As someone scheduling a meeting,** I want to see multiple available time slots so that I can choose what works best for my schedule
- **As a meeting participant,** I want to receive calendar invites and confirmation details so that I have all meeting information readily available

### Secondary Users (Manager)
- **As a manager,** I want to authenticate securely and access my assistant's configuration so that I can maintain control over the system
- **As a manager,** I want to set my preferred meeting windows and buffer times so that Athena schedules meetings according to my availability preferences
- **As a manager,** I want to configure working days and time zones so that Athena respects my schedule boundaries
